# AutoPatchingScheduler
Scheduler for monthly autopatching

This currently contains two parts.  RHS5 is for Red Hat Satellite version 5 and LDS is for Landscape Dedicated Server.

It seems likely that RHS5 will also work with spacewalk and it seems likely that LDS will work with normal Landscape.

I've also added a compile all the things section.  This may not be that useful to others in it's entirity, but you could probably harvest bits.
